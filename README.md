# gin-rest-boilerplate

This is an easily extendible go RESTful API boilerplate using the [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) web framework.

The boilerplate was designed to be bare-bones in its implementation. No integrated auth, databases, external middleware packages, external logging packages, etc. It is up to the developer to flesh out these details.

It also aims to follow [idiomatic go](https://dmitri.shuralyov.com/idiomatic-go) and [common project standards](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout).
